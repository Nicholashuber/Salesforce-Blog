# Advanced Salesforce Trigger Design Patterns: Ensuring Efficiency and Scalability

Salesforce triggers are a powerful tool for automating business logic, but poor implementation can lead to inefficiencies, recursion issues, and governor limits. In this blog post, we’ll explore **advanced trigger design patterns** to ensure your triggers are **scalable, efficient, and easy to maintain**.

## Why Use Trigger Design Patterns?

A well-structured trigger follows best practices to prevent issues like:

- Recursive loops
- Unnecessary SOQL queries (leading to governor limits)
- Poor maintainability due to excessive logic in a single trigger

Implementing **Trigger Handler Patterns** can help maintain **a clean and optimized approach to Salesforce automation**.

## Best Practices for Advanced Trigger Design

### 1. The One-Trigger-Per-Object Rule

Having multiple triggers on the same object can lead to execution order unpredictability. Instead, use **a single trigger per object** and delegate logic to a handler class.

#### Example: Using a Trigger Handler

```apex
trigger AccountTrigger on Account (before insert, before update, after insert, after update) {
    AccountTriggerHandler.handleTrigger(Trigger.new, Trigger.oldMap, Trigger.operationType);
}
```

By calling a **separate handler class**, we maintain cleaner, more structured code.

### 2. Using Trigger Frameworks for Scalability

Apex Trigger Frameworks like **TriggerHandler** help you scale automation by centralizing logic.

#### Example: Base Trigger Framework

```apex
public abstract class BaseTriggerHandler {
    public virtual void beforeInsert(List<SObject> newRecords) {}
    public virtual void beforeUpdate(List<SObject> newRecords, Map<Id, SObject> oldRecords) {}
}
```

### 3. Prevent Recursive Trigger Execution

If a trigger modifies records that cause another trigger to fire, an **infinite loop** may occur.

#### Solution: Use Static Variables

```apex
public class TriggerHelper {
    private static Boolean isTriggerRunning = false;
    
    public static Boolean shouldRun() {
        if (isTriggerRunning) return false;
        isTriggerRunning = true;
        return true;
    }
}
```

This ensures your trigger **only runs once per transaction**, preventing unintended recursion.

### 4. Bulkifying Apex Triggers

Hardcoded SOQL queries inside loops are a common mistake in trigger development.

#### Bad Example (Governor Limits Risk)

```apex
for (Account acc : Trigger.new) {
    Contact c = [SELECT Id FROM Contact WHERE AccountId = :acc.Id LIMIT 1]; 
}
```

#### Optimized Example

```apex
Map<Id, Account> accounts = new Map<Id, Account>([SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Id IN :Trigger.newMap.keySet()]);
```

This approach **retrieves all necessary records in a single SOQL query**, preventing **governor limit exceptions**.

## Conclusion

By implementing these **advanced Apex trigger design patterns**, you can ensure your Salesforce triggers remain **efficient, scalable, and maintainable**. Whether you're handling complex business logic or automating workflows, following these best practices will **future-proof your org’s automation**.
