# Understanding Apex Transactions and Governor Limits in Salesforce

Salesforce’s multitenant architecture ensures that resources are shared fairly among tenants. To maintain performance and stability, Salesforce enforces **governor limits**—thresholds that Apex code must stay within during execution.

This blog post demystifies **Apex transactions**, explains critical **governor limits**, and provides actionable strategies to ensure your automation scales without breaking.

---

## What Is an Apex Transaction?

An **Apex transaction** is a set of operations that execute as a single unit. If one operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.

### Examples of Apex Transactions:

- A trigger firing during a record update
- An Apex class invoked via Flow or Process Builder
- A REST API call that invokes Apex logic

Each transaction is bounded by its **governor limits**.

---

## Why Do Governor Limits Exist?

Salesforce’s multitenancy model means thousands of orgs run on the same infrastructure. Governor limits:

- Ensure fair resource distribution
- Prevent runaway code from degrading system performance
- Encourage efficient coding practices

---

## Key Apex Governor Limits to Know

| Limit | Value (Synchronous) |
|-------|---------------------|
| Total SOQL queries | 100 |
| Total DML statements | 150 |
| CPU time | 10,000 ms |
| Heap size | 6 MB |
| Callouts | 100 |
| Records retrieved by SOQL | 50,000 |
| Future method calls | 50 |
| Queueable jobs added | 50 |

**Note**: Asynchronous limits differ and are generally more lenient.

---

## Understanding Limit Usage

Use the `Limits` class to monitor resource usage in real-time:

```apex
System.debug('SOQL queries used: ' + Limits.getQueries());
System.debug('SOQL queries limit: ' + Limits.getLimitQueries());
```

You can also use this dynamically in logic to prevent limit overrun.

## Tips to Avoid Governor Limit Errors

### 1. **Bulkify Apex Code**

Never assume one record per transaction. Use `Trigger.new` as a collection.

**Bad:**

```apex
for (Account acc : Trigger.new) {
    insert new Contact(LastName = 'Test', AccountId = acc.Id);
}
```

**Good:**

```apex
List<Contact> contacts = new List<Contact>();
for (Account acc : Trigger.new) {
    contacts.add(new Contact(LastName = 'Test', AccountId = acc.Id));
}
insert contacts;
```

### 2. **Avoid SOQL/DML in Loops**

Querying or performing DML inside loops is a surefire way to hit limits.

### 3. **Use Collections and Maps**

Aggregate data using maps and sets to optimize lookups and avoid duplicate processing.

---

## Asynchronous Apex and Limits

When your code needs to do more than what synchronous limits allow, go **asynchronous**.

### Options:

- **Future Methods**
- **Queueable Apex**
- **Batch Apex**
- **Scheduled Apex**

Each has its own use case and limit thresholds.

---

### Example: Queueable Apex

```apex
public class MyQueueableJob implements Queueable {
    public void execute(QueueableContext context) {
        // logic here
    }
}
System.enqueueJob(new MyQueueableJob());
```

Use Queueables for chaining jobs and handling larger data volumes.

---

## Transaction Boundaries in Triggers

A single DML action (e.g., mass update of records) can fire multiple triggers, but they execute as **one transaction**.

This means:

- All changes are committed together
- Limits are shared across all involved logic
- Rollbacks affect the entire transaction

**Always test bulk scenarios** to ensure compliance under realistic data volumes.

---

## Exception Handling in Apex Transactions

Use try/catch blocks to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent full rollbacks when possible.

```apex
try {
    insert someRecords;
} catch (DmlException ex) {
    // Log error, send notification
}
```

---

## Monitoring and Debugging Governor Limits

### Tools:

- **Debug Logs**: View SOQL, DML, CPU usage
- **Developer Console**: Monitor executions
- **Apex Test Execution**: Validate unit tests against limits
- **Salesforce Optimizer**: Highlights limit-heavy components

---

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Use Platform Events

Offload operations to asynchronous subscribers via Platform Events.

### 2. Split Data Batches

If working with large data volumes, process them in smaller chunks to stay under limits.

### 3. Transaction Finalizers

In Queueable Apex, use `System.finalizer` to run post-processing logic regardless of success/failure.

## Real-World Scenario: Mass Lead Reassignment

Suppose you’re reassigning 10,000 leads to a new owner.

**Bad Approach:**

```apex
for (Lead l : allLeads) {
    l.OwnerId = newOwnerId;
    update l;
}
```

**Good Approach:**

- Chunk data into 200 record batches
- Use Queueable Apex for processing
- Monitor each job’s limit usage
- Log failures using Custom Object or Platform Events

## Conclusion

Understanding Apex transactions and governor limits is fundamental for writing **efficient, scalable, and reliable** Salesforce code. Whether you're optimizing triggers, classes, or integrations, respect for limits ensures your org stays stable and your automation performs flawlessly.
