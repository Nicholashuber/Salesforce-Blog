# Introduction
Null Pointer Exceptions in Apex are runtime exceptions that occur when you try to access a method or property on a null object. They are one of the most common types of exceptions in Apex.

# How They Occur
Null Pointer Exceptions occur when you try to access a method or property on a null object. For example, if you have an object `a` and you try to access a property `b` on `a` (`a.b`) without first checking if `a` is null, you will get a Null Pointer Exception.

# Prevention
To prevent Null Pointer Exceptions, always check if an object is null before trying to access its methods or properties. Here's an example:

```apex
if (a != null) {
    // Now it's safe to access a.b
    System.debug(a.b);
}
```

# Conclusion
By understanding how Null Pointer Exceptions occur and how to prevent them, you can write safer, more robust Apex code.
