# Optimizing SOQL Queries for Performance in Apex

Efficient SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language) queries are crucial for developing high-performance Apex applications on the Salesforce platform. Poorly optimized queries can lead to governor limit exceptions and degraded user experience. In this blog post, we'll explore best practices for optimizing SOQL queries in Apex, provide practical examples, and highlight common pitfalls to avoid.

## Why Optimize SOQL Queries?

Salesforce enforces governor limits to ensure that no single tenant monopolizes shared resources. Exceeding these limits results in runtime exceptions. By optimizing your SOQL queries, you can:

- **Prevent Governor Limit Exceptions**: Stay within the limits for queries and script statements.
- **Improve Application Performance**: Reduce execution time and improve responsiveness.
- **Enhance User Experience**: Provide faster load times and smoother interactions.

## Best Practices for Optimizing SOQL Queries

### 1. **Use Selective Filters**

Ensure your queries retrieve only the necessary records by using selective WHERE clauses.

**Example:**

```apex
// Bad Practice: Retrieves all accounts
List<Account> allAccounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account];

// Best Practice: Retrieves accounts in a specific industry
List<Account> techAccounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Industry = 'Technology'];
```

### 2. **Retrieve Only Required Fields**

Fetch only the fields you need to reduce resource consumption.

**Example:**

```apex
// Bad Practice: Retrieves all fields
Account acc = [SELECT Id, Name, Industry, Phone, BillingAddress, ... FROM Account WHERE Id = :accountId];

// Best Practice: Retrieves specific fields
Account acc = [SELECT Id, Name, Industry FROM Account WHERE Id = :accountId];
```

### 3. **Leverage SOQL for Loops**

Use SOQL for loops to handle large datasets efficiently without hitting heap size limits.

**Example:**

```apex
// Best Practice: SOQL For Loop
for (Account acc : [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Industry = 'Finance']) {
    // Process each account
}
```

### 4. **Avoid Queries Inside Loops**

Placing queries inside loops can quickly consume your governor limits.

**Example:**

```apex
// Bad Practice: Query inside loop
for (Contact con : contactList) {
    Account acc = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Id = :con.AccountId];
    // Process account
}

// Best Practice: Query outside loop
Set<Id> accountIds = new Set<Id>();
for (Contact con : contactList) {
    accountIds.add(con.AccountId);
}
Map<Id, Account> accountMap = new Map<Id, Account>(
    [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Id IN :accountIds]
);
for (Contact con : contactList) {
    Account acc = accountMap.get(con.AccountId);
    // Process account
}
```

### 5. **Use Indexed Fields in WHERE Clauses**

Filtering on indexed fields improves query selectivity and performance.

**Indexed Fields Include:**

- **Primary Keys**: `Id`, `Name`
- **Foreign Keys**: Lookup or master-detail relationship fields
- **Audit Fields**: `CreatedDate`, `SystemModstamp`
- **Custom Indexed Fields**: Fields manually indexed by an admin

**Example:**

```apex
// Using an indexed field (Id)
Account acc = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Id = :accountId];
```

### 6. **Optimize Queries with SOSL**

Use SOSL (Salesforce Object Search Language) when searching across multiple objects or fields.

**Example:**

```apex
// Search for contacts and leads with the keyword 'Acme'
List<List<SObject>> searchResults = [FIND 'Acme' IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Contact(Id, Name), Lead(Id, Name)];
```

### 7. **Implement Query Pagination**

For large datasets, use pagination to process records in manageable chunks.

**Example:**

```apex
Integer offset = 0;
Integer batchSize = 200;
Boolean hasMoreRecords = true;

while (hasMoreRecords) {
    List<Account> accounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account LIMIT :batchSize OFFSET :offset];
    if (accounts.isEmpty()) {
        hasMoreRecords = false;
    } else {
        // Process accounts
        offset += batchSize;
    }
}
```

### 8. **Use Bind Variables**

Prevent SOQL injection and improve performance by using bind variables.

**Example:**

```apex
String industry = 'Technology';
List<Account> accounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Industry = :industry];
```

### 9. **Avoid NULL Comparisons in WHERE Clauses**

Comparing fields to `NULL` can prevent the use of indexes.

**Example:**

```apex
// Avoid
List<Contact> contacts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Contact WHERE Email != NULL];

// Use
List<Contact> contacts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Contact WHERE Email != ''];
```

### 10. **Monitor and Analyze Query Performance**

Use tools like the **Query Plan Tool** in the Developer Console to evaluate and optimize query performance.

**Example:**

```apex
// Analyze this query in the Query Plan Tool
List<Account> accounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE CreatedDate = LAST_N_DAYS:30];
```

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### **1. Exceeding Governor Limits**

**Governor Limits:**

- **Total number of SOQL queries**: 100 per synchronous transaction
- **Total number of records retrieved by SOQL queries**: 50,000

**Solution:**

- Bulkify your code to process multiple records in a single query.
- Use aggregates like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()` to reduce the number of records retrieved.

**Example:**

```apex
// Using COUNT() to get the number of contacts
Integer contactCount = [SELECT COUNT() FROM Contact WHERE AccountId = :accountId];
```

### **2. Inefficient Use of LIKE Operator**

Using leading wildcards in the `LIKE` operator prevents index utilization.

**Example:**

```apex
// Avoid leading wildcard
List<Account> accounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Name LIKE '%Tech'];

// Use trailing wildcard
List<Account> accounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Name LIKE 'Tech%'];
```

### **3. Not Using Relationship Queries**

Fetching related records efficiently by using relationship queries.

**Example:**

```apex
// Bad Practice: Separate queries
List<Contact> contacts = [SELECT Id, AccountId FROM Contact WHERE AccountId IN :accountIds];
List<Account> accounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Id IN :accountIds];

// Best Practice: Relationship query
List<Contact> contacts = [SELECT Id, Account.Name FROM Contact WHERE AccountId IN :accountIds];
```

### **4. Over-Reliance on Formula Fields in WHERE Clauses**

Filtering on formula fields can be less efficient since they are not indexed.

**Solution:**

- Filter on underlying fields that are indexed.
- Consider denormalizing data if necessary.

## Advanced Techniques

### **1. Using Aggregate Queries**

Aggregate functions can reduce the number of records processed.

**Example:**

```apex
// Get total opportunity amounts by account
AggregateResult[] groupedResults = [SELECT AccountId, SUM(Amount) totalAmount FROM Opportunity GROUP BY AccountId];
for (AggregateResult ar : groupedResults) {
    System.debug('Account ID: ' + ar.get('AccountId') + ', Total Amount: ' + ar.get('totalAmount'));
}
```

### **2. Using Async SOQL for Large Data Volumes**

For processing millions of records, consider using Async SOQL (available with Big Objects).

**Note:** Async SOQL is only available in certain editions and requires additional setup.

### **3. Applying Indexing Strategies**

Work with your Salesforce admin to index custom fields that are frequently used in queries.

**Example:**

- **External IDs**
- **Unique fields**
- **Custom indexes requested via Salesforce Support**

## Testing and Monitoring

### **1. Write Unit Tests**

Ensure your queries work as expected and handle different data scenarios.

**Example:**

```apex
@isTest
private class AccountQueryTest {
    @isTest static void testSelectiveQuery() {
        Account acc = new Account(Name = 'Test Tech Account', Industry = 'Technology');
        insert acc;
        
        List<Account> accounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Industry = 'Technology'];
        System.assert(accounts.size() > 0);
    }
}
```

### **2. Use the Developer Console**

Utilize the Query Editor and Execution Plans to analyze query performance.

### **3. Monitor Logs**

Check debug logs for SOQL query counts and time consumed.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Number of SOQL queries: 1 out of 100
```
