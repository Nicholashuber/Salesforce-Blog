# Optimizing Salesforce SOQL Queries: Best Practices for Performance and Limits

When it comes to performance in Salesforce, **SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language)** is often the most underestimated component. Poorly written SOQL queries can lead to governor limit exceptions, slow page loads, and failed batch jobs.

In this blog post, you’ll learn how to write **high-performance, governor-friendly SOQL queries**. Whether you're a developer, architect, or admin working with Apex or automation tools, this guide will help you **optimize every line of your SOQL**.

## Why SOQL Optimization Matters

Salesforce enforces governor limits to ensure efficient resource usage in its multi-tenant environment. These limits include:

- 100 SOQL queries per synchronous transaction
- 50,000 total records retrieved
- 6 million characters of data returned

**Inefficient SOQL usage is the #1 cause of hitting governor limits**. By optimizing your queries, you enhance performance and reduce errors across Apex, Flows, and Integrations.

## Basic Principles of SOQL

Before jumping into advanced techniques, master these fundamentals:

- **SELECT** fields from an object
- Use **WHERE** to filter results
- Order results with **ORDER BY**
- Limit output with **LIMIT**

### Example:

```apex
SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE CreatedDate = LAST_N_DAYS:30 ORDER BY Name ASC LIMIT 50
```

---

## Best Practices for Writing Efficient SOQL

### 1. Use Selective Filters

Avoid broad queries like `SELECT Id FROM Account`. Use filters on indexed fields (e.g., Id, Name, CreatedDate).

**Bad:**

```apex
SELECT Id FROM Contact WHERE LastName != null
```

**Good:**

```apex
SELECT Id FROM Contact WHERE Email LIKE '%@company.com'
```

### 2. Use Only Required Fields

Fetching unnecessary fields increases data load and impacts performance.

**Bad:**

```apex
SELECT * FROM Opportunity
```

**Good:**

```apex
SELECT Id, StageName, Amount FROM Opportunity
```

### 3. Use Limits Wisely

Limit your results when you only need a subset.

```apex
SELECT Id FROM Lead WHERE Status = 'Open' LIMIT 10
```

## Using Relationship Queries

SOQL supports both **parent-to-child** and **child-to-parent** relationships.

### Child-to-Parent:

```apex
SELECT Id, Account.Name FROM Contact WHERE LastName = 'Smith'
```

### Parent-to-Child (Subquery):

```apex
SELECT Name, (SELECT LastName FROM Contacts) FROM Account
```

Avoid overfetching child records, especially in batch operations.

## Indexed Fields and Query Selectivity

Salesforce query optimizer relies on **selective queries**. To be selective:

- Use indexed fields
- Return fewer than 10% of the total rows
- Avoid `NOT`, `!=`, or `LIKE '%value%'`

### Use Query Plan Tool

1. In Developer Console, go to **Query Plan**
2. Paste your SOQL
3. Analyze cost and selectivity

---

## Avoid SOQL in Loops

The most common anti-pattern in Apex:

```apex
for (Account acc : accounts) {
    List<Contact> contacts = [SELECT Id FROM Contact WHERE AccountId = :acc.Id];
}
```

### Fix: Bulkify with IN clause

```apex
Set<Id> accountIds = new Set<Id>();
for (Account acc : accounts) {
    accountIds.add(acc.Id);
}
List<Contact> allContacts = [SELECT Id FROM Contact WHERE AccountId IN :accountIds];
```

---

## Use Query Aggregates and GROUP BY

SOQL supports aggregates like COUNT(), SUM(), and GROUP BY for reporting-style queries.

```apex
SELECT StageName, COUNT(Id) FROM Opportunity GROUP BY StageName
```

Use this for dashboards, analytics, or reporting without exporting data.

## Optimize Queries for Large Data Volumes (LDV)

When working with 1M+ records:

- Always use **indexed fields**
- Use **skinny tables** if approved by Salesforce
- Query in **batches** with LIMIT and OFFSET
- Use **Batch Apex** or **SOQL for loops**

### Batch Apex Example:

```apex
global class LargeAccountProcessor implements Database.Batchable<SObject> {
    global Database.QueryLocator start(Database.BatchableContext BC) {
        return Database.getQueryLocator('SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE IsActive__c = true');
    }
    global void execute(Database.BatchableContext BC, List<SObject> scope) {
        // Processing logic
    }
    global void finish(Database.BatchableContext BC) {}
}
```

## Monitoring SOQL Usage

### 1. Developer Console

- View SOQL logs
- Analyze execution time

### 2. Debug Logs

Enable Apex debug logs and search for `SOQL_EXECUTE_BEGIN` and `SOQL_EXECUTE_END`.

### 3. Salesforce Optimizer Report

Run it from Setup to identify performance risks in your org.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Using SELECT * | Fetches unused data |
| SOQL in loops | Governor limits |
| No filters | Full table scan |
| Too many fields | Slower performance |
| Not testing in sandbox | Unexpected failures |
