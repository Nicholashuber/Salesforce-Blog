# Building Scalable Salesforce Integrations with Platform Events

In today’s API-driven landscape, real-time integration is key. Salesforce Platform Events provide a powerful **event-driven architecture** that helps developers build **scalable, loosely-coupled integrations** across systems.

In this comprehensive guide, you'll learn how to use Platform Events to build responsive, scalable, and maintainable integrations inside and outside of Salesforce.

---

## What Are Platform Events?

Platform Events are part of Salesforce’s **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**, allowing systems to communicate through **publish-subscribe models**. Instead of querying for changes or writing synchronous APIs, you publish and subscribe to events asynchronously.

### Key Benefits:

- **Real-time communication** between systems
- **Decoupling** of apps and logic
- **Improved scalability** via asynchronous processing
- **Transaction boundary control**

## Platform Events vs Traditional Integration

| Feature | Platform Events | REST API | Outbound Messaging |
|--------|------------------|---------|--------------------|
| Real-time | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Asynchronous | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Retry logic | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Order of execution | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Declarative support | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

---

## When to Use Platform Events

- Notify external systems when data changes
- Integrate with middleware like MuleSoft, AWS, or Kafka
- Trigger downstream actions from Apex or Flows
- Replace Outbound Messaging with more reliability

---

## Creating a Platform Event

1. Go to **Setup → Platform Events**
2. Click **New Platform Event**
3. Define the name (e.g., `Order_Event__e`)
4. Add custom fields like `OrderId__c`, `Status__c`, or `CustomerEmail__c`
5. Click Save

Platform Events use the `__e` suffix and behave like sObjects.

---

## Publishing Events from Apex

Publishing a Platform Event is as simple as inserting a record:

```apex
Order_Event__e event = new Order_Event__e(
    OrderId__c = '12345',
    Status__c = 'Shipped',
    CustomerEmail__c = 'user@example.com'
);
Database.SaveResult sr = EventBus.publish(event);
```

You can publish from Apex triggers, classes, or even Flow Builder.

---

## Subscribing to Platform Events

### 1. **Apex Trigger on Platform Events**

```apex
trigger OrderEventTrigger on Order_Event__e (after insert) {
    for (Order_Event__e evt : Trigger.new) {
        System.debug('Received Order ID: ' + evt.OrderId__c);
        // Execute business logic
    }
}
```

### 2. **Process Builder or Flow**

You can create declarative subscribers in Flow Builder that listen to Platform Events and execute logic like record creation or email alerts.

### 3. **External Subscribers**

External systems (e.g., AWS Lambda, Node.js apps) can subscribe via CometD using Salesforce’s Streaming API.

---

## Real-World Use Case: Ecommerce Order Processing

1. **Salesforce** publishes an event when an order is marked "Shipped".
2. **AWS Lambda** listens and updates shipping labels via an external API.
3. **Slack Bot** posts an order shipment update.
4. **Salesforce** triggers follow-up task creation via Flow.

This architecture is fully **asynchronous**, **event-driven**, and **scalable**.

---

## Best Practices for Platform Events

### 1. Monitor Replay IDs

Use replay IDs for durable subscriptions and **guaranteed delivery** in case of disconnections.

### 2. Limit Event Volume

Platform Events are subject to limits (e.g., 150K events/day for Enterprise Edition). Monitor usage via Event Monitoring.

### 3. Batch Processing

Use Apex triggers with future or queueable classes for processing to avoid long-running operations.

### 4. Use EventBus.publish()

Use `EventBus.publish()` to publish events instead of DML for enhanced control and error handling.

### 5. Test with `Test.startTest()` and `Test.stopTest()`

Use `Test.getEventBus().deliver()` in unit tests for reliable testing of event-based logic.

## Platform Events vs Change Data Capture (CDC)

| Feature | Platform Events | Change Data Capture |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Custom fields | ✅ | ❌ |
| Data change tracking | ❌ | ✅ |
| External consumption | ✅ | ✅ |
| Triggers support | ✅ | ✅ |
| Built-in object support | ❌ | ✅ (standard & custom objects) |

Use **CDC for tracking changes** and **Platform Events for broadcasting messages** across apps.

---

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Tools:

- **Event Monitoring Logs**: Track published/subscribed events
- **CometD Clients**: Use Postman or JavaScript clients to test subscriptions
- **Debug Logs**: Capture Apex trigger logs on events
- **Transaction Finalizer**: Ensure retry logic for external system sync

---

## Scaling Tips for Large Orgs

- Batch-trigger processing with **Queueable Apex**
- Create **custom retry logic** for failed subscribers
- Split event schemas by function (e.g., `Shipping_Event__e`, `Inventory_Event__e`)
- Use **platform cache** or **custom metadata** to throttle volumes

## Conclusion

Platform Events are a cornerstone for modern, scalable Salesforce integrations. They provide the speed, flexibility, and decoupling needed to build reliable cross-system architectures.
