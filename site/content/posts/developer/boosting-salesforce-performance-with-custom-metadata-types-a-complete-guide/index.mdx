# Boosting Salesforce Performance with Custom Metadata Types: A Complete Guide

Salesforce offers a rich set of features for automation, scalability, and customization. Yet many Salesforce professionals overlook one of its most powerful tools: **Custom Metadata Types (CMDTs)**. This guide explores how CMDTs can **dramatically improve performance, enable cleaner configurations, and reduce technical debt**—while still giving you room to scale.

## Why Custom Metadata Types Matter

Hardcoded values, switch-case logic, or environment-specific configurations in Apex code are common culprits for performance issues and maintenance nightmares. Custom Metadata Types solve these problems elegantly by allowing metadata to be:

- Deployed from sandbox to production
- Referenced directly in code
- Managed without updates to Apex classes

CMDTs **turn environment-specific configuration into scalable, declarative metadata**.

## What Are Custom Metadata Types?

CMDTs are similar to custom objects but intended **solely for configuration data**. Unlike custom settings, CMDTs are **deployable**, versionable, and accessible in Apex, flows, and formulas.

### Key Features:

- Deployable via change sets or metadata API
- Queryable with SOQL
- Version-controlled in source-driven development
- Compatible with validation rules and workflow

## Real-World Use Cases for CMDTs

### 1. Feature Flags and Toggle Logic

You can control feature visibility using CMDTs to **enable/disable components or automation rules** without code changes.

```apex
public class FeatureToggle {
    public static Boolean isFeatureEnabled(String featureName) {
        Feature__mdt setting = [SELECT IsEnabled__c FROM Feature__mdt WHERE DeveloperName = :featureName LIMIT 1];
        return setting.IsEnabled__c;
    }
}
```

### 2. SOQL Query Definitions

Store reusable query filters or criteria as CMDT records. This improves **query readability and promotes reuse**.

### 3. API Endpoint Management

CMDTs are ideal for storing different API endpoints per environment (dev, test, prod). No more hardcoded strings!

## Creating a Custom Metadata Type

1. Go to **Setup** → **Custom Metadata Types**
2. Click **New Custom Metadata Type**
3. Define your label, object name, and optional description
4. Add custom fields as needed

### Example: API Configuration Type

Fields:
- `Environment__c` (Picklist: Dev, Test, Prod)
- `Endpoint__c` (Text)
- `IsActive__c` (Checkbox)

## Referencing CMDTs in Apex

CMDTs are queryable using standard SOQL syntax.

```apex
List<API_Config__mdt> configs = [SELECT Environment__c, Endpoint__c FROM API_Config__mdt WHERE IsActive__c = true];
for (API_Config__mdt cfg : configs) {
    System.debug('Endpoint for ' + cfg.Environment__c + ': ' + cfg.Endpoint__c);
}
```

## CMDTs vs Custom Settings: Key Differences

| Feature | CMDTs | Custom Settings |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Deployable | ✅ | ❌ (limited) |
| Version-controlled | ✅ | ❌ |
| Usable in Apex/Flows | ✅ | ✅ |
| UI Management | ✅ | ✅ |
| SOQL Support | ✅ | ✅ |
| Metadata Type | Yes | No |

## Best Practices for Using CMDTs

### 1. Use Naming Conventions

Always follow a naming convention (e.g., `FeatureToggle__mdt`, `ApiSettings__mdt`) to keep things clean and searchable.

### 2. Avoid Over-Engineering

Don't overuse CMDTs for minor constants. Use them **only when logic is likely to vary across environments or evolve**.

### 3. Cache Your CMDT Queries

Avoid repetitive SOQL calls by caching CMDT values using static variables or custom wrapper classes.

### 4. Leverage Validation Rules

Apply validation rules to ensure metadata integrity—just like you would with regular objects.

## Advanced Use Case: Declarative Control of Automation Rules

Imagine you have an Apex trigger that should only fire if the organization is in a specific state. Use a CMDT to declaratively manage this logic.

```apex
if (AutomationControl__mdt.getInstance('AccountTrigger').IsEnabled__c) {
    // run trigger logic
}
```

## CMDTs in Flows and Formulas

CMDTs can be accessed in Flow Builder using the **"Get Records"** element. This allows admins to dynamically control logic **without touching code**.

### Example:

- Use CMDTs to manage picklist value mappings
- Trigger record flows based on CMDT-driven criteria

## Conclusion

Custom Metadata Types offer **a powerful way to move logic out of Apex and into configurable metadata**, improving scalability and maintainability. They empower both developers and admins to build cleaner, more dynamic Salesforce orgs.
