# Automating Salesforce Record Updates with Scheduled Flows: A Step-by-Step Guide for Admins

Scheduled Flows are one of the most powerful tools Salesforce has given Admins in recent years. They let you run automations **at specific times without code**, making them ideal for everything from daily data updates to time-based business logic.

In this guide, we’ll walk through everything you need to know to **master Scheduled Flows**, including real-world use cases, best practices, and setup instructions—without touching Apex.

---

## What Are Scheduled Flows?

A **Scheduled Flow** is a type of **Autolaunched Flow** that runs automatically at specified intervals (daily, weekly, or a custom schedule).

Unlike record-triggered flows, these don’t wait for data changes—they **proactively scan and act** on records matching your criteria.

---

## Benefits of Using Scheduled Flows

- No need for Apex code or scheduled batch classes
- Fully declarative and admin-friendly
- Run flows on a schedule (e.g., every night at 2am)
- Great for maintenance tasks, time-based actions, and periodic updates

## When to Use Scheduled Flows

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Data cleanup | Reset flags or outdated records nightly |
| Time-based status updates | Move expired Opportunities to “Closed Lost” |
| Auto-reminders | Flag records due for follow-up |
| Process renewals | Trigger actions for Contracts expiring in 30 days |
| SLA monitoring | Escalate Cases not updated in 72 hours |

## How to Create a Scheduled Flow

### Step-by-Step:

1. Go to **Setup > Flows** → Click **New Flow**
2. Select **Scheduled-Triggered Flow**
3. Set schedule (start date, frequency, and time)
4. Define **Entry Conditions** (optional)
   - Example: `Status = Open AND LastModifiedDate < TODAY() - 5`
5. Use **Get Records** to pull data
6. Apply logic: Assignments, Decisions, Create/Update/Delete
7. Save and **Activate**

---

## Real-World Example: Auto-Close Stale Opportunities

### Objective:

Automatically close Opportunities that haven’t been updated in 60 days and are still Open.

### Steps:

1. **Schedule**: Run nightly at 1am
2. **Get Records**:
   - Object: Opportunity
   - Filter: `StageName != 'Closed Won' AND LastModifiedDate < TODAY() - 60`
3. **Loop**: For each Opportunity, set `StageName = 'Closed Lost'`
4. **Update Records**: Save the changes

You’ve now automated a common sales hygiene task—without any code.

## Best Practices for Scheduled Flows

### 1. Test in Sandbox First

Run test versions using narrow filters and confirm updates with debug logs or test reports.

### 2. Use Fault Paths

Always connect flow elements to **Fault connectors** to catch errors and log them appropriately.

### 3. Keep Limits in Mind

Salesforce limits the number of records a flow can process. Use filters to stay below thresholds or break up jobs.

- **50K records per execution**
- **Scheduled flows run in batch context**

### 4. Use Email Alerts or Logging

Send notifications on success/failure, or write outcomes to a custom Log object for tracking.

## Tools to Pair with Scheduled Flows

- **Custom Metadata Types** – Drive dynamic logic like thresholds or trigger windows
- **Queues** – Assign records to a queue after updates
- **Reports** – Monitor flow effectiveness via dashboards
- **Permission Sets** – Secure flow access for admins only

---

## Monitoring Flow Execution

Use **Setup > Scheduled Jobs** to confirm scheduled flow runs and inspect any failures.

Also:

- Use **Debug Logs** during testing
- Build **Flow Error Reports** for non-admin monitoring

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Not testing entry criteria | Preview record count via report first |
| No fault connectors | Always handle errors |
| Overloading flow logic | Use Subflows for modular design |
| Processing too many records | Filter down or use batch strategies |

---

## Bonus: Dynamic Scheduling Using Custom Metadata

Advanced Admins can control schedule logic using CMDTs. Example:

- CMDT record stores “SLA Days = 3”
- Flow calculates if Case last touched date > SLA Days
- Automatically flags or escalates

This makes your Scheduled Flows **configurable without editing the Flow** itself.

---

## Conclusion

Scheduled Flows allow Salesforce Admins to automate repetitive tasks, enforce time-based processes, and manage data proactively—without ever touching Apex. Mastering them gives you powerful control over your org’s business processes.
