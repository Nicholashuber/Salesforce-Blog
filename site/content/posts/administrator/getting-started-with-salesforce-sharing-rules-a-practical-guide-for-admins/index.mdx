# Getting Started with Salesforce Sharing Rules: A Practical Guide for Admins

Proper data access is at the heart of every successful Salesforce implementation. While Organization-Wide Defaults and Roles control baseline access, **Sharing Rules** give Admins the flexibility to grant access based on real business needs.

In this practical guide, we’ll break down how to use **Salesforce Sharing Rules** to open up record access safely and strategically—**without compromising data security**.

---

## What Are Sharing Rules?

Sharing Rules allow Admins to **extend record access beyond the role hierarchy**. They are declarative configurations that open up access based on:

- Record Owner
- Criteria (field values)
- Public Groups, Roles, or Territories

---

## Why Sharing Rules Matter

| Benefit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Scalable access control | Extend visibility without changing roles |
| Least privilege model | Maintain security while improving usability |
| Simplified admin management | Declarative, no-code setup |
| Improved collaboration | Share across departments or regions |

---

## Types of Sharing Rules

1. **Owner-Based Sharing Rules**  
   Grants access based on **who owns the record**.

2. **Criteria-Based Sharing Rules**  
   Grants access based on **field values** (e.g., Region = “West”).

3. **Guest User Sharing Rules**  
   Extends access to unauthenticated users via Experience Cloud.

## Sharing Rule Capabilities by Object Type

| Object | Supports Criteria-Based? | Supports Owner-Based? |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Standard Objects (e.g., Account) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Custom Objects | ✅ | ✅ |
| Activities (Tasks/Events) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Campaigns, Opportunities | ✅ | ✅ |

---

## How to Create a Sharing Rule

### Step-by-Step:

1. Go to **Setup → Sharing Settings**
2. Choose the object (e.g., Account)
3. Click **New Sharing Rule**
4. Select **Based on owner** or **Based on criteria**
5. Define the source (who) and target (who gets access)
6. Choose access level: **Read Only** or **Read/Write**
7. Save and deploy

---

## Real-World Example: Sharing Opportunities by Region

### Scenario:

West Coast Sales team needs to see all Opportunities with Region = "West".

### Solution:

- Create a **Criteria-Based Sharing Rule**
- Object: Opportunity
- Criteria: `Region__c = 'West'`
- Share with: Public Group “West Sales”
- Access: Read/Write

Now reps outside the owner hierarchy can collaborate on deals.

---

## Using Public Groups for Flexibility

Public Groups simplify sharing rule maintenance.

**Why use Public Groups?**

- Combine users, roles, and territories
- Use the same group in multiple rules
- Easier to manage than custom roles

**Example**: Public Group = Support Leadership  
Includes: Role = Support Manager, User = ExternalConsultant

---

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting Sharing

### Tools for Admins:

- **Sharing Button** on records (classic only or via Lightning component)
- **Why Can’t I See This Record?** Lightning feature
- **Debug Logs** for manual sharing triggers
- **Sharing Settings Reports** (custom-built)

---

## Common Use Cases for Sharing Rules

| Use Case | Type |
|----------|------|
| Share high-value Accounts with Legal | Owner-Based |
| Open read-only access to East Region Cases | Criteria-Based |
| Let partner users view certain Opportunities | Criteria-Based |
| Make all Product records visible to Marketing | Owner-Based |

---

## Tips and Best Practices

### 1. Keep It Simple

Avoid excessive sharing rules—combine where possible.

### 2. Use Groups Instead of Roles

They’re easier to manage and more flexible.

### 3. Review Sharing Hierarchy Regularly

Ensure rules still align with organizational structure and compliance.

### 4. Avoid Performance Bottlenecks

Too many sharing rules can impact sharing recalculations during data updates.

## Advanced Options

- **Apex Managed Sharing**: Custom logic via code for complex scenarios
- **Manual Sharing**: One-off record sharing by owners
- **Territory Model Sharing**: Advanced field sales orgs
- **Sharing Sets**: For Experience Cloud users

## Limitations to Be Aware Of

| Limitation | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Read/Write only | Cannot grant delete access |
| Lookup fields | Can’t drive criteria from related object fields |
| Activities | Limited to owner-based sharing |
| Recalculation delay | Rules take time to apply to large datasets |

---

## Conclusion

Salesforce Sharing Rules provide Admins with a powerful way to **expand access while maintaining control**. By using Owner- and Criteria-Based rules strategically, you can support collaboration, enforce security, and ensure users get the access they need—no more, no less.
