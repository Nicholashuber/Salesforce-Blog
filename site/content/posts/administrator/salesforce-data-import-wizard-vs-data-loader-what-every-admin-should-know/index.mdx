# Salesforce Data Import Wizard vs Data Loader: What Every Admin Should Know

Data import is a core responsibility for every Salesforce Admin. Whether you're loading leads, updating contacts, or migrating historical data, choosing the **right tool** is critical.

Salesforce offers two primary tools for importing data—**Data Import Wizard** and **Data Loader**. In this guide, you'll learn when to use each, how they differ, and how to avoid common import pitfalls while maintaining data integrity.

---

## Why Data Import Matters

Poorly imported data can lead to:

- Duplicates
- Field mismatches
- Broken automation
- Incomplete records

Choosing the right import method ensures your Salesforce org stays clean, accurate, and trustworthy.

## Tool Overview: Import Wizard vs Data Loader

| Feature | Data Import Wizard | Data Loader |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| Interface | Web-based UI | Desktop app |
| Supported Objects | Limited (e.g., Lead, Contact, Account, Custom) | All standard/custom |
| Volume | Up to 50,000 records | Up to 5 million records |
| Automation Trigger | No (skips workflows/triggers) | Yes (triggers automation) |
| Scheduling | No | Yes (via CLI or Task Scheduler) |
| Duplicates Management | Basic matching | Requires external dedupe |
| Error Handling | Basic | Detailed CSV error file |

---

## When to Use the Data Import Wizard

**Best For:**

- New Admins
- Smaller datasets (<50,000 records)
- Lead, Contact, Account imports
- Custom Object uploads
- Avoiding trigger execution (safe testing)

### Example Use Case:

Import 2,000 leads captured from a recent trade show.

- Tool: **Import Wizard**
- Object: Lead
- Duplicate Rule: Match by email
- Skip Workflow Rules: ✅

Simple and effective for non-technical admins.

## When to Use the Data Loader

**Best For:**

- Large data volumes
- Full object support
- Scheduled imports/updates
- Triggering automation
- Exporting records

### Example Use Case:

Migrate 200,000 Opportunity records from another system.

- Tool: **Data Loader**
- Operation: Insert or Upsert
- Mapping: External ID for Account
- Execution: In batches to prevent governor limits

## Installation & Setup

### Data Import Wizard

- No installation needed
- Navigate to **Setup > Data Import Wizard**
- Select object, upload file, map fields

### Data Loader

1. Download from **Setup > Data Loader**
2. Install on Windows or Mac
3. Login via OAuth or username/password
4. Choose operation (Insert, Update, Upsert, Delete)
5. Map fields and execute

Optional: Set up **Command Line Interface (CLI)** for scheduled jobs.

## Supported Operations

| Operation | Import Wizard | Data Loader |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Insert | ✅ | ✅ |
| Update | ✅ | ✅ |
| Upsert | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete | ❌ | ✅ |
| Export | ❌ | ✅ |
| Hard Delete | ❌ | ✅ |

## Data Loader CLI (Advanced)

Admins with scripting knowledge can automate imports via command line:

- Create `.sdl` mapping files
- Schedule jobs using Task Scheduler (Windows) or cron (Mac/Linux)
- Monitor logs and error files

Great for nightly updates or integrations.

---

## Best Practices for Clean Imports

### 1. Always Backup Before Importing

Export current data in case rollback is needed.

### 2. Validate in Sandbox First

Run import scenarios in a sandbox or developer org before executing in production.

### 3. Clean Your Data

Remove duplicates, correct formatting, and standardize picklist values.

### 4. Use External IDs

Avoid mismatches by mapping records with a unique identifier (e.g., Email, SKU, ERP ID).

### 5. Review Field Mapping Carefully

Check for type mismatches (e.g., text into number fields).

## Real-World Example: Account and Contact Import

### Scenario:

You're importing 3,000 new Accounts and 6,000 related Contacts.

### Approach:

1. Import Accounts using Data Import Wizard or Data Loader
2. Export new Account IDs if needed
3. Prepare Contact import file with matching `AccountId`
4. Import Contacts using Data Loader (for flexibility)

This ensures relational data integrity and faster processing.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Choosing wrong tool for volume | Use Data Loader for >50k records |
| Ignoring validation rules | Clean and format data before upload |
| Overwriting with incorrect field maps | Double-check all mappings |
| Not handling duplicates | Use Matching Rules or dedupe tool |
| No backup plan | Always export first |

- **DemandTools** – Advanced import + transform
- **Jitterbit** – ETL tool for large-scale data sync
