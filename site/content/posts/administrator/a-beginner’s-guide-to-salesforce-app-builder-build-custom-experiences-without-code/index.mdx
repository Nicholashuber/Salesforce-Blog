# A Beginner’s Guide to Salesforce App Builder: Build Custom Experiences Without Code

The **Salesforce App Builder** is a powerful tool that allows Admins to create custom, flexible, and user-friendly Lightning Apps—all with clicks, not code.

Whether you're designing record pages, home pages, or app-specific layouts, this guide walks you through everything you need to know to **master App Builder and elevate your org’s user experience**.

---

## What Is the Lightning App Builder?

Lightning App Builder is a point-and-click interface for designing pages in Salesforce. You can drag and drop components to create:

- **Record Pages** (e.g., Account, Opportunity)
- **Home Pages** (user dashboards)
- **App Pages** (custom app experiences)

It supports both standard and custom components, visibility rules, and third-party integrations.

## Why Use App Builder?

| Benefit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| No coding required | Drag-and-drop UI for fast customization |
| Personalized user experience | Customize layouts by profile or app |
| Reusability | Build components once and reuse across pages |
| Responsive design | Works across desktop and mobile |
| Declarative logic | Use visibility filters for dynamic layouts |

## Page Types Explained

### 1. **Record Pages**

Customize how users view and interact with records. Great for:

- Adding related lists, tabs, charts
- Embedding Flows or components
- Dynamic visibility of sections

### 2. **Home Pages**

Design dashboards, announcements, and task reminders on login.

### 3. **App Pages**

Build app-specific pages for business units or user roles.

## Key App Builder Components

- **Standard Components**: Tabs, Related Lists, Chatter, Activities
- **Custom Components**: Built with Aura or LWC
- **Third-party Components**: Installed from AppExchange
- **Dynamic Forms**: Show/hide fields based on logic
- **Report Charts**: Visuals tied to dashboards

## Creating a Lightning App Page (Step-by-Step)

### Example: Sales Productivity Page

1. Navigate to **Setup > Lightning App Builder**
2. Click **New** > Select **App Page**
3. Name the page: “Sales Dashboard”
4. Choose **1 Region** or **2 Columns Layout**
5. Drag components:
   - **Today’s Tasks**
   - **Opportunity Pipeline Chart**
   - **Recent Opportunities List View**
6. Save and **Activate**
7. Assign to **Sales App** and profiles

---

## Using Dynamic Visibility Rules

You can control component visibility based on:

- **Field values** (e.g., Stage = Closed Won)
- **User Profile**
- **Record Type**
- **Device type** (mobile vs desktop)

This allows a personalized experience per user.

---

## Example: Manager-Only Component

Add a “KPI Summary” chart visible **only to users with Profile = Sales Manager**.

**Rule Setup**:

- `Advanced Visibility Rule`
- `Profile.Name = "Sales Manager"`

Now reps won’t see clutter they don’t need.

## Best Practices for Using App Builder

### 1. Plan Your Layout

Sketch before building. Focus on priority data and key actions.

### 2. Use Tabs and Accordions

Avoid long scroll pages by organizing into tabs or collapsible sections.

### 3. Keep Mobile in Mind

Test layouts on the Salesforce Mobile App for responsiveness.

### 4. Minimize Components per Page

Too many components can slow page loads. Keep it focused.

### 5. Document Your Pages

Track custom pages and their assignments for maintenance.

## Real-World Use Case: Custom Case Management Page

### Goal:

Give support reps an efficient view for managing open cases.

### Solution:

- Base: Custom Case Record Page
- Tabs:
  - Case Details
  - Related Contacts
  - Knowledge Articles
- Dynamic Components:
  - Escalation Info (shown only if `Status = Escalated`)
  - SLA Countdown (based on priority)

Outcome: Faster resolution, cleaner UI, better adoption.
